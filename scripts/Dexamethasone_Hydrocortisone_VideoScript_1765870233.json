The now activated Dexamethasone-NR3C1 complex then moves towards and enters the cell nucleus through a nuclear pore.",

A 'Competition for NR3C1' graphic overlays the scene.",
        "narration": "Now, consider Dexamethasone's interaction with Hydrocortisone, a natural glucocorticoid. Both compete for the same NR3C1 receptor. Dexamethasone, however, has significantly higher potency and receptor affinity, allowing it to outcompete Hydrocortisone. This can diminish Hydrocortisone's effects, especially critical in replacement therapies or when managing the body's natural stress response."
