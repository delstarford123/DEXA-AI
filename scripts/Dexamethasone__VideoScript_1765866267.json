        "visuals": "Stylized cell cross-section. Dexamethasone molecule enters the cytoplasm. An inactive Glucocorticoid Receptor (NR3C1) bound to heat shock proteins (HSPs) is shown. Dexamethasone binds to NR3C1, causing HSPs to dissociate and the receptor to undergo a conformational change.",
        "narration": "Upon entering a target cell, Dexamethasone binds to the inactive Glucocorticoid Receptor, NR3C1, located in the cytoplasm. This binding event induces a crucial conformational change in the receptor."

The complex then binds to specific DNA sequences called Glucocorticoid Response Elements (GREs), initiating transcription of target genes by RNA polymerase. Show mRNA synthesis.",
        "narration": "The activated Dexamethasone-NR3C1 complex then translocates into the nucleus, binding to specific DNA sequences known as Glucocorticoid Response Elements. This genomic interaction profoundly modulates the expression of numerous target genes, affecting various cellular functions."

(Note: Tacrolimus is used as an example for the user's unspecified interacting drug).",
        "narration": "Now, let's consider a critical drug interaction. For this example, we'll use Tacrolimus, a vital immunosuppressant. Tacrolimus is primarily metabolized and eliminated from the body by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, or CYP3A4, predominantly found in the liver."

Transition to the liver cell, showing a significant increase in the number of CYP3A4 enzymes. Illustrate Tacrolimus molecules being rapidly broken down by the elevated CYP3A4 activity.",
        "narration": "Crucially, Dexamethasone, through its genomic actions, powerfully *induces* the expression of CYP3A4. This means the body produces more of this enzyme, leading to a significantly accelerated metabolism of drugs like Tacrolimus."

A 'Risk' icon (e.g., exclamation mark) appears with text: 'Reduced Tacrolimus Efficacy -> Risk of Transplant Rejection'. Quick recap of Dexamethasone's dual action: receptor binding and enzyme induction. Fade out with Dexamethasone molecule.",
        "narration": "This accelerated metabolism dramatically lowers Tacrolimus levels, risking therapeutic failure and, for transplant patients, increasing the severe risk of organ rejection. Understanding these complex molecular interactions is paramount for safe and effective drug administration."
