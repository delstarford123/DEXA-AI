The complex undergoes a conformational change, then translocates into the nucleus and binds to specific DNA sequences (Glucocorticoid Response Elements - GREs), illustrating modulation of gene expression (mRNA synthesis depicted as increased/decreased).",
        "narration": "Inside the cell, Dexamethasone acts by binding to its primary target: the NR3C1, or Glucocorticoid Receptor. This drug-receptor complex then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences, modulating gene expression to exert its profound therapeutic effects."

Rifampicin is shown entering the liver cell and stimulating the increased production/activity of CYP3A4 enzymes. Subsequently, Dexamethasone molecules entering the liver cell are rapidly intercepted and metabolized (broken down) by the activated CYP3A4 enzymes.",
        "narration": "However, Dexamethasone's efficacy can be significantly impacted by other medications. Consider Rifampicin, an antibiotic that is also a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme in the liver. This enzyme is primarily responsible for Dexamethasone's metabolism."

        "narration": "When taken concurrently, Rifampicin dramatically accelerates Dexamethasone's breakdown, leading to lower active drug concentrations and potentially compromising its intended anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive benefits. Always consult your doctor about potential drug interactions."
