        "visuals": "A zoomed-in view of a cell membrane. A Dexamethasone molecule enters the cytoplasm. An inactive Glucocorticoid Receptor (NR3C1), initially associated with heat shock proteins (HSPs), is shown. Dexamethasone binds to NR3C1, causing a conformational change and dissociation from HSPs. The activated Dexamethasone-NR3C1 complex then translocates into the cell nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences (GREs), demonstrating inhibition of inflammatory gene transcription.",
        "narration": "At the molecular level, Dexamethasone exerts its effects by entering the cell and binding to the Glucocorticoid Receptor, also known as NR3C1, in the cytoplasm. This binding activates the receptor, prompting it to move into the nucleus. Here, the complex modulates gene expression, notably suppressing the production of inflammatory proteins, thereby reducing inflammation."

Introduce a second drug, Ketoconazole, explicitly showing it binding to and inhibiting CYP3A4. Visualize a buildup of unmetabolized Dexamethasone molecules in the bloodstream due to this inhibition. A 'Warning' or 'Risk Increased' icon appears.",
        "narration": "Dexamethasone is primarily metabolized and eliminated from the body by the CYP3A4 enzyme in the liver. However, when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as Ketoconazole, this metabolic pathway can be significantly blocked. This crucial interaction leads to higher systemic concentrations of Dexamethasone, intensifying its effects and substantially increasing the risk of adverse side effects."
