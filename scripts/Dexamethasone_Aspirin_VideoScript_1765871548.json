        "visuals": "Zoom into a stylized cell. A cytoplasmic Glucocorticoid Receptor (NR3C1), depicted as an inactive, coiled protein, is shown. The Dexamethasone molecule approaches and precisely docks into the ligand-binding domain of NR3C1, causing a visible conformational change in the protein. The activated complex is highlighted.",
        "narration": "Dexamethasone works by entering cells and binding to its primary target: the Glucocorticoid Receptor, or NR3C1. This specific protein binding activates the receptor, initiating a cascade of genetic changes that lead to its therapeutic anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions."

Both Dexamethasone and Aspirin molecules are shown near the gastric mucosa. Highlight areas of irritation/damage on the mucosal barrier, with a red glow intensifying as both drugs are present. A 'warning' icon flashes.",
        "narration": "Now, consider Aspirin. While beneficial for pain and cardiac health, combining it with Dexamethasone carries a significant risk. Both drugs can independently disrupt the stomach's protective barrier. Dexamethasone potentiates Aspirin's gastrointestinal ulcerogenic effects, drastically increasing the risk of severe stomach ulcers and bleeding."
