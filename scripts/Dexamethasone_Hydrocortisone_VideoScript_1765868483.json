        "visuals": "A dormant NR3C1 protein (Glucocorticoid Receptor) complex, associated with chaperone proteins (e.g., HSP90), is shown. Dexamethasone approaches the NR3C1 protein. It docks perfectly into the binding pocket, inducing a conformational change. Chaperone proteins detach and float away. The Dexamethasone-bound NR3C1 complex then begins translocating towards the nucleus.",
        "narration": "Once inside, Dexamethasone specifically binds to the NR3C1 receptor. This binding event triggers a critical conformational change, activating the receptor and initiating its journey to the nucleus to modulate gene expression."

        "visuals": "Another dormant NR3C1 receptor complex is shown. Now, a detailed 3D molecular model of Hydrocortisone (Cortisol) appears, distinct from Dexamethasone but structurally similar, also attempting to bind. Dexamethasone then swiftly enters the scene, approaching the *same* NR3C1 receptor. Dexamethasone reaches the receptor first and binds with high affinity, displacing or preventing Hydrocortisone from binding. Highlight Dexamethasone's stronger grip/tighter fit.",
        "narration": "Our body's natural glucocorticoid, Hydrocortisone, also targets NR3C1. However, Dexamethasone possesses a significantly higher affinity and potency for this receptor. Observe how Dexamethasone efficiently outcompetes Hydrocortisone for the available binding sites."

        "visuals": "Multiple NR3C1 receptors are shown, predominantly bound by Dexamethasone (glowing intensely). Very few, if any, are bound by Hydrocortisone. A 'WARNING' or 'RISK' icon flashes briefly next to the Dexamethasone-bound receptors. Arrow indicating downstream effects are amplified.",
        "narration": "This potent competitive binding means Dexamethasone's effects will largely dominate the cellular response. The primary risk: Dexamethasone can profoundly alter therapeutic outcomes or amplify glucocorticoid-related side effects due to its superior receptor affinity and activity, effectively overshadowing Hydrocortisone's intended actions."
