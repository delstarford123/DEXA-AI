Aspirin molecules enter the scene, demonstrating a stronger affinity and displacing Hydrocortisone from albumin binding sites. The newly 'free' Hydrocortisone molecules are highlighted. These free Hydrocortisone molecules then diffuse into a cell, approaching and binding to the Glucocorticoid Receptor (NR3C1) inside the cell. Show a conformational change in NR3C1 upon binding, indicating activation and potential nuclear translocation.",
