Combine both effects, illustrating severe gastric mucosal damage, erosion, or ulceration. A prominent 'WARNING: Increased Gastric Ulcer & Bleeding Risk' text flashes.",
        "narration": "However, combining Hydrocortisone with Aspirin significantly heightens gastric ulcer risk. Hydrocortisone decreases protective gastric mucus. Aspirin directly irritates the stomach lining and inhibits protective prostaglandins. This synergistic effect drastically increases the chance of bleeding and ulceration in the stomach."
