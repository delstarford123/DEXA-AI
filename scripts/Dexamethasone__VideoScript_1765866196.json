A dormant Glucocorticoid Receptor (NR3C1) protein complex (larger, multi-subunit structure, possibly with chaperone proteins like HSP90) is visible. Dexamethasone binds to NR3C1, causing a conformational change and dissociation from chaperones. The activated Dexamethasone-NR3C1 complex then translocates into the cell nucleus.",
        "narration": "Once inside the cell, Dexamethasone binds to the inactive Glucocorticoid Receptor, or NR3C1, in the cytoplasm. This binding activates the receptor, allowing the complex to move into the nucleus where it modulates gene expression, reducing inflammation and suppressing immune responses."

Dexamethasone is shown being metabolized/broken down by CYP3A4. Introduce Ketoconazole molecules entering the cell and strongly binding to and inhibiting CYP3A4. Show Dexamethasone molecules now unable to be metabolized, accumulating in the bloodstream. A 'Risk' icon appears.",
        "narration": "However, interactions can occur. Dexamethasone is primarily metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. If a patient is also taking Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the metabolism of Dexamethasone is significantly reduced. This leads to higher systemic concentrations of Dexamethasone, increasing the risk of adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, immunosuppression, and Cushing's syndrome-like symptoms."
