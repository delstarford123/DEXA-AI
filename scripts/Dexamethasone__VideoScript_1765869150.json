Both drugs converge, leading to visual erosion and ulceration of the stomach lining. A prominent 'WARNING' overlay with a bleeding stomach icon.",
        "narration": "A critical interaction: Dexamethasone combined with NSAIDs like Naproxen significantly elevates the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. Dexamethasone impairs protective mucus production, while Naproxen inhibits vital prostaglandins, weakening the stomach's natural defenses, leading to a dangerous synergistic effect."

It then binds specifically to a 3D model of the NR3C1 protein (Glucocorticoid Receptor) in the cytoplasm. The Dexamethasone-NR3C1 complex undergoes a conformational change and translocates into the nucleus, approaching DNA strands.",
        "narration": "Inside the cell, Dexamethasone exerts its primary action by binding to the NR3C1, the Glucocorticoid Receptor. This drug-receptor complex then moves into the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression, switching on or off specific genes to mediate its powerful anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects."
